# minsizer
Automatically compress JPEG/JFIF, PNG*, BMP**, GIF*** and TIFF*** images into WebP or AVIF using cwebp, gif2webp, avifenc, cavif, tiff2png, bmp2png and magick.

(cwebp, gif2webp, avifenc, cavif, tiff2png, bmp2png and magick) ARE provided with release packages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Automatically compress JPEG/JFIF, PNG, BMP, GIF and TIFF images into WebP or
AVIF using cwebp, gif2webp, avifenc, cavif, tiff2png, bmp2png and ImageMagick
with the highest quality possible (lossless or lossy >99%) and highest posible
compression effort.

Can also try and recompress WebP using ImageMagick.

Important notices:

PNG:
Unavoidable data loss: APNG is unsupported. APNG animation will be LOST!
Data loss warning:     Alpha-channel is not preserved by default and will be
                       LOST!
Inefficiency:          When preserving alpha-channel, cavif is disabled as it
                       does not support transparency. avifenc is used instead,
                       but it has worse compression ratio.
Compatibility issue:   AVIF files produced by cavif can be incorrectly reported
                       as "corrupted" by Mozilla Firefox and Safari.
BMP:
Data loss warning: If a PNG file with the same name is present in the same
                   folder, it will be LOST. This is an oversight caused by
                   bmp2png and cannot be easily fixed.
GIF:
Compatibility issue: Most software do not support animated WebP.

TIFF:
Data loss warning: Alpha-channel is not preserved by default and will be LOST!
Inefficiency:      When preserving alpha-channel, cavif is disabled as it does
                   not support transparency. avifenc is used instead, but it has
                   worse compression ratio.
Data loss warning: If a PNG file with the same name is present in the same
                   folder, it will be LOST. This is an oversight caused by
                   tiff2png and cannot be easily fixed.

Only the smallest resulting file is kept. If the original (unconverted) file was
kept as smallest, it will not be converted next run (skipped).

Almost in-place conversion. Requires at most 6x (BMP/TIFF) / 5x (PNG) / 4x (JPG)
as much disk space as the largest image by file size in the dataset.

Conversion time depends mostly on your hardware and can easily reach multiple
hours and even days when converting large datasets (thousands of pictures).
JPG is faster to convert, PNG is slower and BMP and TIFF are slowest.

Does not accept arguments to pass-through to codecs! Edit source code to see
defaults and tweak codec parameters. See cwebp, gif2webp, avifenc, cavif, 
bmp2png and tiff2png manpages to understand parameters.

Dependencies (cwebp.exe, gif2webp.exe, avifenc.exe, cavif.exe, bmp2png.exe,
tiff2png.exe, magick.exe) are expected to be found in ./lib subfolder or on PATH
